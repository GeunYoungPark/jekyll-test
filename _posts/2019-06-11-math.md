**Substitution**  
> If numerical value of each letter is given to you in an algebraic expression then the corresponding letters can be substitute in the numbers and hence find the value of the expression.   

> Keep in mind a concept of variables or pronumerals   

**Glossary**  
- monomials 단항식
    : an algebraic expression consisting of one term
- binomials or polynimials 이항식 혹은 다항식
    an expression of more than two algebraic terms
- Like terms 동류항
    : Letters or group of letters are identical except for the leading number in front.   
- terms 항  
- coefficient 계수  
- expand : to remove grouping symbols or brackets   

**Exmples**
1. monomials : $x,-2y,3x^2$   
2. polynomials : $x-2y+3x^2$   
3. In polynomials, each one $x,-2y,3x^2$ is called terms.  
4. In $-2y,3x^2$, -2 and 3 are called coefficient.  


**Removing Grouping symbols**  
_Grouping symbols_ means `Brackets`. In other words, it is called "EXPAND".  

$a(b+c) = ab + bc$   
$a(b-c) = ab - bc$  

A minus sign outside of a bracket reverses the sign inside of the bracket, since $-1*-1=1$    
    $-a(b-c) = -ab + bc$  

**Adding and subtracting in algebra** 
1. In algebra, one can only add or subtract _like terms_  
2. The sign alywas belongs to the term directly after it. 
3. How to Expand polynomials  
    - Remove brackets
    - Add like terms 
    - Rearrange terms of polymonials from higher order to lower order
    - simplify them by adding and subtrating. 

**Exercise**   
Expand: 

1. $6(a-3)$  
2. $-(3-2x)$
3. $4m(m+5)$
4. $5(x+3)+4(x-2)$
5. $3x(2x-4)-(3-2x)$
6. When P, Q, R are given below, expand $P-Q-5R$  
    $P = 4x^2y + 7y^3 + x^3$, $Q= 2x^3-y^3 + 5xy^2$,  $R= -xy^2 -2x^2y-x^3+y^3$

Answer 
6) $4x^3+14x^2y+3y^3$
